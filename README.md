# minishell2.0
This project is about creating a simple shell. You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors.


The objective of Minishell is to develop a shell.

A shell is a crucial component of an operating system that consists of two main elements:

The kernel: It carries out essential functions of the operating system, such as managing memory, processes, and files.

The shell: It serves as the interface between the user and the kernel, enabling users to interact with the operating system through a command language. Users can input commands in the terminal, and with the help of a command line interpreter (like bash or zsh, which are shells), the entered commands are executed. In our case, we will create our own compact shell.
